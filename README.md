# Image Classification

### Notes 
- In file **project_version_1** only 6 classes of images are considered to perform the classification and 15 epochs. Then with the same classes another trial is made with less epochs to avoid overfitting and the result is in the **12_epoche.png** image.
- In file **project_version_2** 9 classes are used , and also a model regularizer is added with 9 epochs.
